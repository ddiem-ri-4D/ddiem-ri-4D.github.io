Currently, I'm focusing on my thesis about Link Prediction on Knowledge Graphs. It is a small problem in knowledge graph completion that can be solved with many approaches such as entity alignment or the approach I'm working on. In the field of researching Complex Network and Representation Learning on Graph, there are many topics that I think are so interesting, like Graph Classification, Graph Matching, etc.  In order to improve performance, I must have knowledge about basic models, pooling methods on graphs, graph type, and analysis. Next month, I will take my vacation for Lunar New Year, so it is a good time to learn something new, especially by reading some books. Not only for my vacation but also for the whole year to improve my skill in the academic field and tech skills. I will add newer books to the list if I finish the old ones haha.

Besides that, learning new technologies sounds like a good idea for the new year. I plan to learn about Linux and some new programming languages. First, with Linux, I have already tried many Window Tilling Manager like i3, xmonad on Arch Linux, but I'm not really good at it. So in this year, I will try my best to learn how to use it like a pro. There are some programming languages that I'm interested in. Rust and Julia are two things I will focus on.
